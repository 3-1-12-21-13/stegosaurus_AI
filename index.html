      <h2>About Stegosaurus</h2>
      <p>The Stegosaurus is a herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 155 to 150 million years ago. It was a large, heavily built quadrupedal dinosaur with distinctive bony plates on its back and a spiked tail. The name Stegosaurus means "roofed lizard" or "covered lizard", referring to the bony plates that lined its back.</p>
